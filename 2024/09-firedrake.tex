\title{The modern CUDA ecosystem: how to talk to your GPU}
\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
  Firedrake emerged, in part, from projects looking at finite elements
  on GPUs, but that was in the depths of history and we swiftly
  pivoted to a CPU-centric approach.

  A decade later, there is interest in revisiting this decision, and
  both the hardware and software have moved on since the last time
  Firedrake tried this in anger. As well as a much broader ecosystem
  of GPU libraries, there is also renewed interest in making the core
  programming experience harder to misuse. To that end, I'll present
  some thoughts on device-side libraries and programming abstractions
  for writing fast kernels correctly.
