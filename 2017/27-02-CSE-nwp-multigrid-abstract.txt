High Level Implementation of Geometric Multigrid Solvers for Finite
Element Problems: Applications in Atmospheric Modelling

In recent years, finite element methods have gained popularity in the
numerical weather prediction community due to their ability to deal
with non-orthogonal meshes and high order discretisations.  Compatible
(or mimetic) spaces offer some appealing features for models such as
stable discretisations of pressure gradients and geostrophic balance.
However, they present challenges in solving the elliptic system
resulting from implicit timestepping schemes.  The high aspect ratio
domains typical in these problems require us to treat the "vertical"
direction specially when designing a solver if we want to achieve
mesh-independent iteration counts.

In this talk I will discuss work in the Firedrake finite element
framework on developing custom geometric multigrid solvers for these
problems and present an analysis of the resulting performance, solving
problems with up to two billion degrees of freedom.
