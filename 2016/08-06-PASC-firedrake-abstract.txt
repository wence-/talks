The complexity inherent in the application of advanced numerics on
modern hardware to coupled physical systems presents a critical
barrier to simulation development.  To overcome this, we must create
simulation software which embodies the abstraction and composability
of the underlying mathematics.  In this way, a system is created in
which mathematicians, computer scientists, and application specialists
can each deploy their own expertise, benefiting from the expertise of
the others.  Critically, this approach minimises the extent to which
individuals must become polymaths to share in these advances.

In this talk I will present Firedrake and PyOP2, a composition of new
and existing abstractions which creates a particularly complete
separation of concerns.  This enables the creation of high
performance, sophisticated finite element models from a very high
level mathematical specification and has enabled advances in computer
science and numerics, while also facilitating the creation of
simulation systems for a variety of applications.
